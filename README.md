# AI-Use-Productivity

Project created for the practical part of my Final Course Work in Computer Science graduation.

### Project description

This project was developed to measure how much the use of Generative AI tools can optimize the daily work of a Software Developer.

### About the experiment

A simple web platform was developed that presents a technical challenge and collects the developer's solution, as well as the total time to complete the challenge.

### Experiment procedure

Two groups of developers were selected, randomly and equally divided. One group would be authorized to use Generative AI tools to help solve the technical challenge, while the other group would not be authorized to use such tools, requiring them to resort to different consultation methods to solve the challenge.
